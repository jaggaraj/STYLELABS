# SEGMENTATION OF MARKET

The 100 responses were divided into two groups with sizes of 47 and 53, respectively, via the k-modes clustering method. The combination of age group, salary, event, and preferences determined the clustering. The modes, or most frequent values, for each cluster were revealed. These revealed that Cluster 1 was defined by individuals between the ages of 36 and 45 who made over $100,000 per year, attended festivals, and preferred trendy styles, while Cluster 2 was defined by individuals between the ages of 26 and 35 who made over $50,000 per year, went on dates, and preferred casual styles.Responses are divided into two segments; based on this, we can design marketing strategies accordingly to cater to the preferences of each segement of customers.

#  DATA CLEANING

imports the necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and 
ydata_profiling for generating a profile report of the dataset.

The ProfileReport function from the ydata_profiling library is called on the dt DataFrame to generate a descriptive report of the dataset.
The code then displays the entire dt DataFrame.
The dt['marks'] column is cleaned by removing certain special characters (!#$%@}{][|^&''""*^)()) from each entry using the str.strip() method.
Similarly, the dt['name'] column is cleaned by removing special characters and digits from each entry using str.strip().
The DataFrame is then truncated to include only the first 20 rows using dt = dt.iloc[:20].
Any missing values (NaN) in the DataFrame are filled with an empty string ' ' using dt = dt.fillna(' ').
Finally, the cleaned and processed DataFrame dt is displayed.
